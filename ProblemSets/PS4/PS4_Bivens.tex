\section{Scraping Interests}
    I am interesting in scraping data from online auction resell apps (eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, etc.). This is purely self serving as I want to gather and analyze data on price determinants in a resale market for my personal side hustle.
    
\section{Code Answers}
\begin{enumerate}
\item class(df1) = data.frame
      class(df) = SparkDataFrame
\item When running head command on df1, the response is:
Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
  unable to find an inherited method for function ‘select’ for signature ‘"data.frame", "NULL"’
  This is probably due to the command being specific to an R data frame and not a SparkR data frame
\item When running the filter command for df1:
Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
  unable to find an inherited method for function ‘filter’ for signature ‘"data.frame", "logical"’
  Again, this is because R commands are very specific to the structure of the object in question. df1 is not a data.frame => these commands do not know how to run with how it is structured.
\end{enumerate}
