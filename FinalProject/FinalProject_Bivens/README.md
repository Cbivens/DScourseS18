# README For Final Project

# Project

The purpose of this project is to create a prediction model for market share for the ready-to-eat cereal market. The file FinalProject_Bivens.pdf contains a paper covering the results and research to create a linear regression model. Model estimations are covered in the second table appendixed at the end of the pdf.

# Reproduction

The FinalProject_Bivens.R file gives the R code to reproduce all results. The original data set was given in stata, therefore, code is given at the beginning to transform the file into a .csv for use with free programming software packages. The script runs first through the cleaning process, then visualization and finally creating the regression. Regression estimates are included in the code comments under the model. 

# Data

The data used is not accessible for public use. However, the script can be used as a guide to create a model given a dataset that has product characteristics, firm costs, and pricing characteristics.
